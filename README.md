# Work-Day-Scheduler
>Use this amazing app to organize your hectic 9-5 schedule!

When the user opens the scheduler, there are blank rows for each hour. 
Hours that have passed will be in light green, the current hour will be bright, emerald green, and future hours will be in golden yellow. 

When activities are entered and saved, they will remain on the scheduler even when the browser has been refreshed.
